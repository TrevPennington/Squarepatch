title: 2020 Guide to Squarespace Plugins - 7.1 & 7.0

This guide will explain how to add any CSS plugin <a href='/animated%20Nav/'>(like this Squarepatch one)</a> to Squarespace official templates (7.1 & 7.0).
<br />
<br />

#Check your Squarespace Version

First, find out which Squarespace version you are running (7.1 or 7.0). This can be found by clicking the <em>Help</em> tab of the main menu when editting your site. As you can see we are using Squarespace 7.0 for this guide, but the steps are exactly the same for both 7.0 & 7.1.

<br />
<br />

Now we know which code to grab for the plugin. Any plugin you use should specify which Squarespace version it runs on. Squarepatch code files will contain both if available, so pick the one that corresponds to your version.
Highlight and copy the code to your clipboard (command+C).
<br />
<br />

#Paste the code

Navigate to <em>Design</em> in the main editor menu and click on <em>Custom CSS</em>. Here you will paste the code into the white box. If there is code already there from another plugin, just find empty space at the bottom to insert your new code.
